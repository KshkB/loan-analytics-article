    "A loan $L$ is defined by three parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the principal amount $(P)$;\n",
    "- the rate of interest $(r)$;\n",
    "- compounding $(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to set, at the outset, the units of time used to express the interest rate. Let $u$ be the unit of time (e.g., it could be days, months, years etc.). Interest is expressed in units $u$. Compounding refers to the number of times interest is applied on the loan principal. With compounding set to $1$, this means the interest is compounded once every $u$ times (e.g., once per year, if $u$ is *years*). This gives the interpretation of interest as the rate at which the principal value of the loan grows over one unit of time, $u$.  More generally, if compounding is $n$, then interest $r$ as expressed per unit $u$ is applied on the principal $n$-many times over a single time period $u$. This is equivalent to the interest $r/n$ being applied every $(1/n)$-time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example.** *If $u$ is years, $r$ is expressed as \"percent per year\". If compounding is $n = 2$, then $r$ is applied twice per year. And so, over a year, the principle $P$ will grow to $P(1 + r/2)$ by the first half of the year. By the end of the year, it will be $P(1 + r/2)^2$.* \n",

The loan lifetime is the elapsed time $t_0$ such that $\\nu_{L_\\infty, R}(t_0) = 0$. It can be expressed analytically as follows,\n",
